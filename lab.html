      First things first<br/>
I'ma say all the words inside my head<br/>
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh<br/>
The way that things have been, oh ooh<br/>
Second thing second<br/>
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be<br/>
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh<br/>
The master of my sea, oh ooh<br/>
I was broken from a young age<br/>
Taking my sulking to the masses<br/>
Write down my poems for the few<br/>
That looked at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me<br/>
Singing from heartache from the pain<br/>
Taking my message from the veins<br/>
Speaking my lesson from the brain<br/>
Seeing the beauty through the<br/>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br/>
(Pain, pain)<br/>
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer<br/>
(Pain)<br/>
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br/>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from<br/>
(Pain)<br/>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br/>
Third things third<br/>
Send a prayer to the ones up above<br/>
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh<br/>
Your spirit up above, oh ooh<br/>
I was choking in the crowd<br/>
Building my rain up in the cloud<br/>
Falling like ashes to the ground<br/>
Hoping my feelings, they would drown<br/>
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<br/>
Inhibited, limited<br/>
'Til it broke up and it rained down<br/>
It rained down, like<br/>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br/>
(Pain, pain)<br/>
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer<br/>
(Pain)<br/>
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br/>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from<br/>
(Pain)<br/>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br/>
Last things last<br/>
By the grace of the fire and the flames<br/>
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh<br/>
The blood in my veins, oh ooh<br/>
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<br/>
Inhibited, limited<br/>
'Til it broke up and it rained down<br/>
It rained down, like<br/>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br/>
(Pain, pain)<br/>
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer<br/>
(Pain)<br/>
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<br/>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from<br/>
(Pain)<br/>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br/>
