    <h2>About the Site</h2>
    <p>
      This site is where I test out HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
    </p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a teenager who is currently interested in web design. Right now, all I know is HTML/CSS and a tiny bit of javascript - but I'm always learning!
      <br />
      What can I say about myself? I like to read in my free time, and I enjoy Imagine Dragons music.
      <br />
      Scratch that, I don't just enjoy Imagine Dragons music, I have an unhealthy obsession with it.

    <h2>Why I am Osiris</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;I started using the name 'Osiris' online in the summer of 2017. I was using a children's coding website called 'Scratch', and I felt like I could create awesome things and gain
      more followers if I cleaned up my profile. I couldn't bring myself to delete my old projects, so I created a new account. I named it after the ancient Egyptian god of rebirth to symbolize
      my new start.
