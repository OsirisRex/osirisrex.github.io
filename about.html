    <h2>About the site</h2>
    <p class="aboutDesc">
      This is my personal site. I used to use it to test out HTML and CSS, but now it's more of a portfolio.
    </p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="aboutDesc">
      I am a teenager who is currently interested in web design. Right now, all I know is HTML/CSS and a tiny bit of Javascript - but I'm always learning!
What can I say about myself? I like to read in my free time, and I enjoy Imagine Dragons music.
  </p>
  <h2>Why I am Osiris</h2>
  <p class="aboutDesc">
     I started using the name 'Osiris' online in the summer of 2017. I was using a children's coding website called 'Scratch', and I felt like I could create awesome things
     and gain more followers if I cleaned up my profile. I couldn't bring myself to delete my old projects, so I created a new account. I named it after the ancient Egyptian
     god of rebirth to symbolize my new start. If all Osiris and -Osiris- usernames are taken on a website, then I resort to using Osiris Rex as my name, like that of the
     space probe.
